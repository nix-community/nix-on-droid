Nix package manager on Android, in a single-click installable package. This is
not full [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) running inside Android, but you get easy
access to [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)' vast collection of
(precompiled!) software and the best package manager under the sun. It's
prototype-grade quality as of now, but hey, it works!

It does not require root, user namespaces support or disabling SELinux,
but it relies on `proot` and other hacks instead.
It uses [a fork](https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid-app)
of [Termux-the-terminal-emulator app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app),
but has no relation to [Termux-the-distro](https://termux.com/).
Please do not pester Termux folks about Nix-on-Droid.

This repository contains:

1. Nix expressions that generate a bootstrap zipball,
   which is then used to install Nix package manager on Android
   along with the `nix-on-droid` executable.
2. A module system for configuring the local Nix-on-Droid installation directly
   on the device.

It is only tested with aarch64 (64-bit ARM devices).
It may also support x86 devices, but the developers don't own one
and nobody has reported whether it actually works or not.

Sorry, it would not work on 32-bit ARM devices
and it's not an easy feat to pull off.


## Try it out

Prebuilt stuff resides at https://nix-on-droid.unboiled.info
Install the APK, launch the app, press OK.


## `nix-on-droid` and the module system

### Config file

The Nix-on-Droid system can be managed through a custom config
file in `~/.config/nixpkgs/nix-on-droid.nix` as generated on first build,
for example:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  environment.packages = [ pkgs.vim ];
  system.stateVersion = "19.09";
}
```

An alternative location is `~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix` with the key
`nix-on-droid`, for example:

```nix
{
  nix-on-droid =
    { pkgs, ... }:

    {
      environment.packages = [ pkgs.vim ];
      system.stateVersion = "19.09";
    };
}
```

Currently there is no complete list of all available options. Please have a
look inside the `./modules` directory for all modules.

### [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) integration

To enable `home-manager` you simply need to follow the instructions already provided in the example `nix-on-droid.nix`:

1.  Add `home-manager` channel:
    ```
    nix-channel --add https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/archive/release-19.09.tar.gz home-manager
    nix-channel --update
    ```
2.  Configure `home-manager`:
    ```nix
    { pkgs, ... }:

    {
      # insert nix-on-droid config

      home-manager.config =
        { pkgs, ... }:
        {
          # insert home-manager config
        };

      # or if you have a separate home.nix already present:
      home-manager.config = import ./home.nix;
    }
    ```

### `nix-on-droid` executable

This executable is responsible for activating new configurations:
Use `nix-on-droid switch` to activate the current configuration and
`nix-on-droid rollback` to rollback to the latest build.

For more information, please run `nix-on-droid help`.


## Build stuff on your own

The [terminal emulator part](https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid-app)
is probably not interesting for you, just download and use a prebuilt one.
If you really want to rebuild it, you can just use Android Studio for that.

The zipball generation is probably what you are after.
Get an x86_64 computer with Nix. Run one of the following:
```
nix build -f ./pkgs --argstr arch aarch64 bootstrapZip
nix build -f ./pkgs --argstr arch i686 bootstrapZip
```

Put the zip file from `result` on some HTTP server
and specify the parent directory URL during the installation.
To re-trigger the installation, you can use
'clear data' on the Android app (after backing stuff up, obviously).
Now that we have an upgrade path for everything,
this should not be needed anymore.

If you want to change the nix-on-droid channel to your custom one,
you can do that either with `nix-channel` after the installation,
or by using `--argstr nixOnDroidChannelURL <URL>`.

**Note**: The `proot` binary is currently not build on the android device
because we are not able to pre-build and cache the proot package in cachix.
The reason for that is that `proot` needs to be cross-compiled with bionic
toolchain which results in different nix store paths in comparison to building
it natively on the device.

The current workaround is to hardcode the path to the wanted `proot` nix store
path in `modules/environment/login/default.nix`. During evaluation time on
the android device this store path will be downloaded from the binary cache
(<https://nix-on-droid.cachix.org/>). This in return means the `proot`
derivation has to be present there or in any other binary cache configured
in the `nix.conf` on the device.


## Tips

* To grant the app access to the storage, use the toggle in the app settings
  (reachable from Android settings).
* If the terminal freezes, use 'Acquire wakelock' button in the notification
  and/or tone down your device's aggressive power saving measures.


## Technical overview

OK, real brief.

Developer's device:

0. Required tools are compiled or downloaded in pre-compiled form
1. `proot` for the target platform is cross-compiled against `bionic`,
   (to fake file paths like `/nix/store`; think 'userspace `chroot`')
2. Target `nix` is taken from the original release tarball
3. Target `nix` database is initialized (with host `proot` and `qemu-user`)
4. Support scripts and config files are built with `nix` and the Nix-on-Droid
   module system
5. From these, a bootstrap zipball is built and published on an HTTP server

User's device:

6. Android app is installed and launched, bootstrap URL is entered
7. Bootstrap zipball gets downloaded and unpacked
8. 'First boot' begins, Nix builds the environment
   (or, possibly, pulls it from Cachix)
9. Nix installs the environment (login scripts, config files, etc.)
