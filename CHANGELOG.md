# Changelog

## Release 21.05 (unreleased)

### New Options

* The `/etc/nix/nix.conf` file is now fully configurable with the
  new options `nix.*`.

## Release 20.09

### State version changes

These changes are only active
if the `system.stateVersion` option is set to `"20.09"` or later.

* `home-manager.useUserPackages` now defaults to `true`.
  The developers are not aware of any adverse effects so far.

### Other compatibility considerations

* Pre-module-system installations are not supported anymore with this release.
  If you are not on `release-19.09` yet,
  either or attempt an upgrade to `release-19.09`
  and follow the instructions, or backup and reinstall (preferred).

### Nix flakes support

* A `flake.nix` file was added.

### Known issues

* If `make` fails on your device with `Function not implemented`,
  report that in https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid/issues/91
  and consider either
  [remote building](https://github.com/t184256/nix-on-droid/wiki/Remote-building)
  or setting `system.workaround.make-posix-spawn.enable = true;`
